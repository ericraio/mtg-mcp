308. Kindreds



308.1. Each kindred card has another card type. Casting and resolving a kindred card follows the rules for casting and resolving a card of the other card type.



308.2. Kindred subtypes are usually a single word long and are listed after a long dash: “Kindred Enchantment — Merfolk.” The set of kindred subtypes is the same as the set of creature subtypes; these subtypes are called creature types. Kindreds may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3m for the complete list of creature types.



308.3. Some older kindred cards were printed with the “tribal” card type. Cards printed with that type have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
