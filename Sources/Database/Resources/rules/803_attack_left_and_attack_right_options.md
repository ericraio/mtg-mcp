803. Attack Left and Attack Right Options



803.1. Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right rules.



803.1a If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their left, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects. If a player’s nearest opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.



803.1b If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their right, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects. If a player’s nearest opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.
