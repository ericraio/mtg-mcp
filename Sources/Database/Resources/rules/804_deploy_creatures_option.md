804. Deploy Creatures Option



804.1. The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it can be used in other variants that allow players to compete in teams. Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually don’t use this option.



804.2. Each creature has the ability “{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Activate only as a sorcery.”
