720. Omen Cards



720.1. Omen cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.



720.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the left defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while it’s a spell. The card’s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the right.



720.2a If an effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that “has an Omen,” it refers to an object that has the alternative characteristics of an Omen spell, even if the object currently doesn’t use them.



720.2b The existence and values of these alternative characteristics are part of the object’s copiable values.



720.2c Although omen cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each omen card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded an omen card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.



720.3. As a player casts an omen card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or as an Omen.



720.3a When casting an omen card as an Omen, only the alternative characteristics are evaluated to see if it can be cast.



720.3b While on the stack as an Omen, the spell has only its alternative characteristics.



720.3c If an Omen spell is copied, the copy is also an Omen. It has the alternative characteristics of the spell and not the normal characteristics of the card that represents the Omen spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a spell cast as an Omen refers to the copy as well.



720.3d As an Omen spell resolves, its controller shuffles it into its owner’s library instead of putting it into its owner’s graveyard as it resolves.



720.4. In every zone except the stack, and while on the stack not as an Omen, an omen card has only its normal characteristics.



720.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose an omen card’s alternative name, the player may do so.
