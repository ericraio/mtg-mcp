102. Players



102.1. A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players.



102.2. In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player.



102.3. In a multiplayer game between teams, a player’s teammates are the other players on their team, and the player’s opponents are all players not on their team.



102.4. A spell or ability may use the term “your team” as shorthand for “you and/or your teammates.” In a game that isn’t a multiplayer game between teams, “your team” means the same thing as “you.”
