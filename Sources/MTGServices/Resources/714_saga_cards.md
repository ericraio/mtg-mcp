714. Saga Cards



714.1. Each Saga card has a striated text box containing a number of chapter symbols. Its illustration is vertically oriented on the right side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.



714.1a Saga enchantments that also have the type creature are printed with both a power and toughness box and an additional text box below the type line. Any abilities in that text box are independent of its chapter symbols.



714.2. A chapter symbol is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability referred to as a chapter ability.



714.2a A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as “{rN}.” The numeral I represents 1, II represents 2, III represents 3, and so on.



714.2b “{rN}—[Effect]” means “When one or more lore counters are put onto this Saga, if the number of lore counters on it was less than N and became at least N, [effect].”



714.2c “{rN1}, {rN2}—[Effect]” means the same as “{rN1}—[Effect]” and “{rN2}—[Effect].”



714.2d A Saga’s final chapter number is the greatest value among chapter abilities it has. If a Saga somehow has no chapter abilities, its final chapter number is 0.



714.2e A Saga’s final chapter ability is the chapter ability which has its final chapter number in its chapter symbol.



714.3. Sagas use lore counters to track their progress.



714.3a As a Saga without the read ahead ability enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As a Saga with the read ahead ability enters the battlefield, its controller chooses a number from one to that Saga’s final chapter number. That Saga enters the battlefield with the chosen number of lore counters on it. (See rule 702.155, “Read Ahead.”)



714.3b As a player’s precombat main phase begins, that player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control with one or more chapter abilities. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.



714.4. If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent with one or more chapter abilities is greater than or equal to its final chapter number, and it isn’t the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that Saga’s controller sacrifices it. This state-based action doesn’t use the stack.
