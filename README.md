# MTG MCP Servers

A Swift implementation of Magic: The Gathering (MTG) Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, providing deck management and card search capabilities through the MCP protocol.

## Overview

This project provides two MCP servers:

1. **MTG Deck Manager** (`mtg-mcp`) - Game state management including deck loading, card drawing, mulligans, and sideboarding
2. **Scryfall API Server** (`scryfall-mcp`) - Card information retrieval using the Scryfall API

Both servers implement the MCP protocol for seamless integration with MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop.

## Features

### MTG Deck Manager
- **Deck Loading**: Parse and load deck lists in various formats
- **Game State Management**: Track deck, hand, and sideboard contents
- **Card Drawing**: Draw cards from deck to hand with proper shuffling
- **Mulligan Support**: London mulligan implementation
- **Sideboarding**: Swap cards between main deck/sideboard and hand
- **Game Reset**: Reset to initial game state
- **Statistics**: Real-time deck and hand statistics

### Scryfall API Server
- **Card Search**: Advanced card search using Scryfall query syntax
- **Random Cards**: Generate random cards with optional filters
- **Name Lookup**: Find cards by exact or fuzzy name matching
- **Rich Card Data**: Complete card information including images, prices, and legalities

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Swift 6.2 or later
- macOS 13 or later

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mtg-mcp

# Build the project
swift build

# Run tests
swift test
```

### Install Executables

```bash
# Build in release mode
swift build -c release

# Install to local bin (optional)
cp .build/release/mtg-mcp /usr/local/bin/
cp .build/release/scryfall-mcp /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

### Running the Servers

#### MTG Deck Manager Server
```bash
# Run with stdio transport (for MCP integration)
swift run mtg-mcp --transport stdio

# Run standalone for testing
swift run mtg-mcp --transport stdio --verbose
```

#### Scryfall API Server
```bash
# Run with stdio transport
swift run scryfall-mcp --transport stdio

# Run with debug output
swift run scryfall-mcp --transport stdio --verbose
```

### MCP Integration

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the servers to your Claude Desktop configuration file. The configuration file is typically located at:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

##### Option 1: Using Swift Run (Development)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mtg-deck-manager": {
      "command": "swift",
      "args": ["run", "mtg-mcp", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mtg-mcp"
    },
    "scryfall-api": {
      "command": "swift", 
      "args": ["run", "scryfall-mcp", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mtg-mcp"
    },
    "rules-splitter": {
      "command": "swift",
      "args": ["run", "rules-splitter"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mtg-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Option 2: Using Built Executables (Production)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mtg-deck-manager": {
      "command": "/path/to/.build/release/mtg-mcp",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio"]
    },
    "scryfall-api": {
      "command": "/path/to/.build/release/scryfall-mcp", 
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Complete Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mtg-deck-manager": {
      "command": "swift",
      "args": ["run", "mtg-mcp", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "cwd": "/Users/ericraio/mcp/mtg-mcp"
    },
    "scryfall-api": {
      "command": "swift", 
      "args": ["run", "scryfall-mcp", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "cwd": "/Users/ericraio/mcp/mtg-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

##### Production Configuration (Recommended)

First, build the executables:
```bash
cd /Users/ericraio/mcp/mtg-mcp
swift build -c release
```

Then use this configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mtg-deck-manager": {
      "command": "/Users/ericraio/mcp/mtg-mcp/.build/release/mtg-mcp",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio"]
    },
    "scryfall-api": {
      "command": "/Users/ericraio/mcp/mtg-mcp/.build/release/scryfall-mcp",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `cwd` path must point to `/Users/ericraio/mcp/mtg-mcp` where Package.swift exists
- Production builds are faster and more reliable than development builds
- Restart Claude Desktop after updating the configuration

#### Verifying the Setup

After adding the configuration:

1. **Restart Claude Desktop**
2. **Start a new conversation**
3. **Test the integration** by asking Claude to:
   - "Show me what MTG tools are available"
   - "Load a simple MTG deck and draw some cards"
   - "Search for Lightning Bolt using Scryfall"
   - "Look up MTG rule 100.1"

#### Tool Usage Examples

Once connected, you can use these tools through your MCP client:

## Example Claude Prompts

Here are example prompts you can use with Claude Desktop once the MCP servers are configured:

### üéÆ **Game Management Prompts**

**"Help me test my burn deck"**
```
Load this burn deck and simulate an opening hand:

4 Lightning Bolt
4 Lava Spike  
4 Monastery Swiftspear
4 Eidolon of the Great Revel
20 Mountain
4 Fireblast

Sideboard:
3 Smash to Smithereens
2 Pyroblast

Then draw 7 cards and tell me what kind of opening hand I got.
```

**"Simulate a mulligan decision"**
```
I want to practice mulligan decisions. Load a competitive deck, draw a 7-card opening hand, and tell me if you think I should keep it or mulligan based on the cards drawn.
```

### üìö **Rules Learning Prompts**

**"Teach me about the stack"**
```
I'm confused about how the stack works in Magic. Can you:
1. Look up the official rules about the stack
2. Explain how priority works with it
3. Give me an example of how spells and abilities resolve
```

**"Combat damage rules"**
```
Look up the official MTG rules about combat damage and explain:
- When damage is dealt
- How first strike works
- What happens with deathtouch
- How trample calculates excess damage
```

### üîç **Card Research Prompts**

**"Find cards for my combo deck"**
```
I'm building an artifact combo deck. Search for:
1. Red instants that cost 3 mana or less
2. Artifacts that produce mana
3. Cards that let me draw cards when artifacts enter

Show me the most relevant options.
```

**"Random deck inspiration"**
```
Give me 5 random cards and help me brainstorm a deck theme that could use all of them together.
```

### üèÜ **Learning & Strategy Prompts**

**"Rules quiz me"**
```
Quiz me on MTG rules! Look up a random rule number and ask me to explain what it means, then show me the official rule text to check my answer.
```

**"Deck analysis"**
```  
Load this deck list and analyze it:
- What's the mana curve?
- What's the game plan?
- What rules should I know for the key cards?
- What are potential weaknesses?

[paste deck list here]

### Code Style

The project follows Swift best practices:
- Swift actors for thread-safe game state management
- Sendable protocol conformance for concurrent access
- Comprehensive error handling with Result types
- Async/await patterns throughout
- Unit tests with >90% coverage

## Architecture

### Thread Safety
Game state is managed using Swift's `actor` system, ensuring thread-safe access to mutable state across concurrent MCP tool calls.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling using Swift's `Result` type and custom error types for different failure scenarios.

### MCP Integration
Both servers implement the MCP protocol using the official Swift SDK, providing:
- Tool registration and discovery
- Request/response handling
- Transport abstraction (stdio, HTTP)
- Proper error propagation
